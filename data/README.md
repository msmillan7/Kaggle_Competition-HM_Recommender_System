Datasets are too big to be uploaded to GIT.


articles.csv - detailed metadata for each article_id available for purchase
customers.csv - metadata for each customer_id in dataset
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
transactions_train.csv - the training data, consisting of the purchases each customer for each date, as well as additional information. Duplicate rows correspond to multiple purchases of the same item. Your task is to predict the article_ids each customer will purchase during the 7-day period immediately after the training data period.
